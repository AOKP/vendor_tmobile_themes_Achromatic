Sample CM9 theme.

** You will need the Android SDK (level 14), ant, and optionally pngcrush **

- Making a theme assumes some previous knowledge of how Android resources
  work. This template has a number of examples for various scenarios
  of resource overriding
- A prebuilt "aapt" is included and used from build.xml. If you're the
  paranoid kind, build your own using the CM9 source tree. Standard
  aapt will _NOT_ work.
- The name of the theme must be wherever you find "TemplateTheme" in here.
  (manifest, strings, themes, build.xml)
- Edit the path to your copy of the android SDK to local.properties
- ../.my-properties is used to release and sign the packages. It needs 
  4 config items:

----------
key.store=/path/to/your.keystore
key.alias=appkey
key.store.password=your-keystore-password
key.alias.password=
-----------

- Build with "ant release", test with "ant debug"
- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE PACKAGES BUILT WITH "ant debug". The Google Play 
  Store doesn't allow them, and you'll be in trouble if you ever
  want to put them there.
